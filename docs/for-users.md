_Flipya_ is a web-based application designed to emulate the process of learning through flash cards. Although flash cards can used to aid in many different kinds of memorization tasks, the main intent here was for foreign language (vocabulary) learning.

_Manual mode:_
Manual mode gives the user complete control of the flash card "action". Click on the card to flip the card over and to flip it back. Click the "Next" button to forward to the next card in the deck. Click the "Prev" button to go back in the deck. A complete history is maintained - back to the first card shown.

_Automatic mode:_
Automatic mode is controlled with the "Go" and "Stop" buttons. A new card will be presented, pause, flip the card, pause, and flip back. Then the next card is presented and the process is repeated.

_Speed:_
Controls speed of card flipping, transitions to new and old cards, and length of pauses when running in automatic mode.

_Flip Deck:_
This option control whether "front" of card is displayed first or "back". For example, for an English to French word set, a word in English would be displayed, flipping the card would show the translation into French. If flip-deck where selected, then the word in French would be shown first. Flipping would show the translation into English. This represents the difference between "production" and "understanding" in language learning.

_Difficulty Range:_
These represent upper and lower bounds on difficulty of words shown. Initial values are determined by the word set in question. The user can then adjust for more or less difficulty in the practice session.

_Practice Set Size:_
A user can select a set-size to practice. This would limit the number of words that would be chosen from. Once all words in the set have been seen once, following words would be random repetition from that limited set. If this option is unchecked, then the entire word set (within difficulty bounds) is fair game.

_Next Set:_
The Next-Set button allows the user to start with a new practice set - or just plain start over, clearing the history of cards.

_Email Session:_
The user has the ability to send an email containing all the words seen so far in the current practice set.

_Login & Logout:_
Users need to register and associate a password with their account for future logins. A user need not associate an email address with their profile; however, this would be necessary in order to have session information sent via email.
